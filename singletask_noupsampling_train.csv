During formations, black hats will likely ask you to pull said things out. Forgetting these things gives you gigs. Like 4 gigs will get you dropped?\n\nThere will be written tests that are pass/fail. Study forsure, but I dont think a single person failed, so I wouldn't worry. Quizlet is a good tool.  \n\n I'm really stretching my memory, but hopefully it gives you an idea.

Thankfully you are doing it at west point because they leave the stuff out so you can practice unlike Campbell (from what I heard). Fucking. Practice. I personally thought it wasnt that bad, but like a quarter of the people in your class will fail because of this.

tag classification,"Free Cornell Expanded Templates (White) Hey,

I was getting a bit frustrated with having to use the Cornell page with the summary, so I've created an extended version which includes:

\- First Page with space for header and no summary

\- Notes Page with space for notes only

\- Summary Page which includes a slightly extended space for the summary

It's just an edit of the existing Goodnotes template, so can be used seamlessly with it.

tag classification,"How storage hungry is Goodnotes 5? **TL;DR: Would a Law/Science student run into storage problems taking notes on GN5 if their iPad Air was 64GB? How much storage do your GN5 notes take up?**

Current devices: MacBook Air 2020, i5 core + 256GB storage and Surface Pro 4 (which I'm planning to replace with iPad Air 4)

Main apps: Chrome, OneNote, Excel, Word, Photoshop, Zoom, Notion, Anki, Google Drive

Currently in a double degree of Law/Science, Sci focus in Developmental Biology/Anatomy, Physiology, Pharmacology. I take a lot of notes, have never used GoodNotes but I'm definitely going to use it soon

I'm looking to get the new iPad Air 4 to primarily use as digital notetaking device so I can use the Apple Pencil (2nd gen I think) with it to create handwritten notes, and then have the notes sync up with my laptop. 

However, I am concerned about the storage options. From what I can see, Apple's only offering 64GB for $800 AUD and 256GB for $1000 (just ballpark of the education pricing). No 128GB option (??!!) 

I really think the 256GB is complete overkill for my use case because I've had my MBA for 6 months and still have over 150 GB free. I tend to throw everything on Google Drive anyway. Also I just don't think I can stomach spending that much on a tablet for handwriting. 

But will the 64GB be just way too small for these things?

* storing 30ish textbook PDFs, annotating them. maybe some casual reading too
* storing case briefs and legislation PDFs, annotating them
* streaming lectures (will not be storing them locally)
* maybe Zoom? But I expect to be doing that on the MBA
* drawing diagrams for anatomy into GN5 or OneNote
* annotating slides in OneNote (insert as printout, doodle all over them)
   * **!!! Can you import lecture slides into GoodNotes and annotate them like you can on OneNote?** 
* typing into Notion (outlines, lecture notes)
* doing my Anki cards. Maybe creating cards as well

I think I'll be fine with the 64GB because I try and store most things on the cloud (gDrive) and can just move it to the MBA if things get full. But I'd really love to hear any input you have on this! I haven't owned an iPad since the iPad 1 lol. 

Also - I'm replacing my Surface Pro 4 with the iPad Air 4 because it's gotten incredibly slow. I've factory reset it a couple of times and it's still really slow to even undo a single pen stroke in OneNote. So I'm concerned that if the storage gets too full, the iPad will start being really sluggish. Would this happen? [""I'm a PhD student and have imported 10-15 books, 70 (so far) articles and book chapters, several notebooks for notetaking (about 100 pages each), probably 30 annotated PDF lectures on my iPad. Once I import any PDF into Goodnotes, the app saves it in the .goodnotes format. And I save and backup all files in the Goodnotes format.  I only export my notes to PDF for storage on Dropbox once I'm satisfied that doc needs no further edits.  Using this method, I'm at 8GB of storage.  However, if Goodnotes adds audio recordings (I can only dream), then I can imagine my library size swelling.\n\nI was kidding myself when I said I would use only Goodnotes on the Ipad.  It turns out Dropbox (for backing up), Procreate (to aid with diagrams) and the Iphoto library (where my screenshots from lecture material or internet go), Notability, and Anki take up another 30 gigs easily.  \n\nI've never experienced a lag on the ipad (except when certain PDF books were graphics intense).  Keep it organised from the start and the incremental backups, won't take long. You've already invested so much in law school already, just spend a few more hundred and never have to worry about this again.  Good luck"", ""So helpful, thanks so much! Some of the textbooks are really long (1k pages) but those ones aren't graphics heavy, just fat slabs of text, and then all my anatomy textbooks are full of pictures and diagrams but I only use one per semester so I'll be able to move the ones I don't need off the device if need be. I think it'll end up being okay. And my slide decks are provided by the University in .pdf format so that's really good! I'm glad the iPad doesn't lag too much once it's full"", ""Thank you so much for this, I hadn't even considered that GN goes though iCloud.. I had an old apple ID when I was quite a bit younger and iCloud's free 15GB filled up so quickly with just photos. And yes I did want my iPad and MBA to talk to each other the same way OneNote syncs across all my devices. I think I would have run into the full cloud storage issue much quicker with OneNote but my institution gives 1TB storage to all students and that's why I haven't noticed things filling up. Seriously thanks 100x for letting me know""]",Question

With Intel I always used XMP, but with Ryzen you get better results by manually optimizing it yourself.  And people helped a lot in terms of sharing what they know.\n\nI do agree with you.. that AMD users.. a large group of them do have a chip on their shoulder.  For many years their products were rubbish, and it's only been in the last few years that they've really transitioned into a competitive and now premium brand.  It used to be a value based budget option only.  Also.. in 20 years, the only CPUs I've ever had fail have been AMD.  But yeah, lately they have become really popular and more mainstream, and I have noticed a change here in the last 12 months.  But I rarely think of this place as toxic though, otherwise I would avoid it and find the resources elsewhere.\n\nI don't understand the whole emotional side of the tech world.  Tech things are based on specs.  It's very robotic and mathematical.  I do care about anti competitive or anti consumer practices, but I've never understood the whole tribal thing in terms of Team Red vs Team Blue.  I use Samsung SSD's because I love their cloning software, the reliability and the speeds (not so much the prices, but if you buy during cashback periods it makes it easier).  It has nothing to do with being Team Black.\n\nTLDR version.. I think what you might be talking about is a lot of AMD users have inferiority complex.  And a lot of NVIDIA and Intel users have superiority complex after dominating the market with superior high end products over the last 10+ years."", 'Mhmm god daddy when can i get under you?ü§§ü§§üòàüòà kik hunter33667', 'This incident isn‚Äôt a big deal, as you noted.
