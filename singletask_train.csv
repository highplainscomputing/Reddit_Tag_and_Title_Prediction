tag classification,"Free Cornell Expanded Templates (White) Hey,

I was getting a bit frustrated with having to use the Cornell page with the summary, so I've created an extended version which includes:

\- First Page with space for header and no summary

\- Notes Page with space for notes only

\- Summary Page which includes a slightly extended space for the summary

It's just an edit of the existing Goodnotes template, so can be used seamlessly with it.

I’m most likely going to be buying an iPad for university (going into second year), and would use goodnotes. I’m just trying to figure out if 32 gb is enough, or if I’d need the 128.

tag classification,"How storage hungry is Goodnotes 5? **TL;DR: Would a Law/Science student run into storage problems taking notes on GN5 if their iPad Air was 64GB? How much storage do your GN5 notes take up?**

Current devices: MacBook Air 2020, i5 core + 256GB storage and Surface Pro 4 (which I'm planning to replace with iPad Air 4)

Main apps: Chrome, OneNote, Excel, Word, Photoshop, Zoom, Notion, Anki, Google Drive

Currently in a double degree of Law/Science, Sci focus in Developmental Biology/Anatomy, Physiology, Pharmacology. I take a lot of notes, have never used GoodNotes but I'm definitely going to use it soon

I'm looking to get the new iPad Air 4 to primarily use as digital notetaking device so I can use the Apple Pencil (2nd gen I think) with it to create handwritten notes, and then have the notes sync up with my laptop. 

However, I am concerned about the storage options. From what I can see, Apple's only offering 64GB for $800 AUD and 256GB for $1000 (just ballpark of the education pricing). No 128GB option (??!!) 

I really think the 256GB is complete overkill for my use case because I've had my MBA for 6 months and still have over 150 GB free. I tend to throw everything on Google Drive anyway. Also I just don't think I can stomach spending that much on a tablet for handwriting. 

But will the 64GB be just way too small for these things?

* storing 30ish textbook PDFs, annotating them. maybe some casual reading too
* storing case briefs and legislation PDFs, annotating them
* streaming lectures (will not be storing them locally)
* maybe Zoom? But I expect to be doing that on the MBA
* drawing diagrams for anatomy into GN5 or OneNote
* annotating slides in OneNote (insert as printout, doodle all over them)
   * **!!! Can you import lecture slides into GoodNotes and annotate them like you can on OneNote?** 
* typing into Notion (outlines, lecture notes)
* doing my Anki cards. Maybe creating cards as well

I think I'll be fine with the 64GB because I try and store most things on the cloud (gDrive) and can just move it to the MBA if things get full. But I'd really love to hear any input you have on this! I haven't owned an iPad since the iPad 1 lol. 

Also - I'm replacing my Surface Pro 4 with the iPad Air 4 because it's gotten incredibly slow. I've factory reset it a couple of times and it's still really slow to even undo a single pen stroke in OneNote. So I'm concerned that if the storage gets too full, the iPad will start being really sluggish. Would this happen? [""I'm a PhD student and have imported 10-15 books, 70 (so far) articles and book chapters, several notebooks for notetaking (about 100 pages each), probably 30 annotated PDF lectures on my iPad. Once I import any PDF into Goodnotes, the app saves it in the .goodnotes format. And I save and backup all files in the Goodnotes format.  I only export my notes to PDF for storage on Dropbox once I'm satisfied that doc needs no further edits.  Using this method, I'm at 8GB of storage.  However, if Goodnotes adds audio recordings (I can only dream), then I can imagine my library size swelling.\n\nI was kidding myself when I said I would use only Goodnotes on the Ipad.  It turns out Dropbox (for backing up), Procreate (to aid with diagrams) and the Iphoto library (where my screenshots from lecture material or internet go), Notability, and Anki take up another 30 gigs easily.  \n\nI've never experienced a lag on the ipad (except when certain PDF books were graphics intense).  Keep it organised from the start and the incremental backups, won't take long. You've already invested so much in law school already, just spend a few more hundred and never have to worry about this again.  Good luck"", ""So helpful, thanks so much! Some of the textbooks are really long (1k pages) but those ones aren't graphics heavy, just fat slabs of text, and then all my anatomy textbooks are full of pictures and diagrams but I only use one per semester so I'll be able to move the ones I don't need off the device if need be. I think it'll end up being okay. And my slide decks are provided by the University in .pdf format so that's really good! I'm glad the iPad doesn't lag too much once it's full"", ""Thank you so much for this, I hadn't even considered that GN goes though iCloud.. I had an old apple ID when I was quite a bit younger and iCloud's free 15GB filled up so quickly with just photos. And yes I did want my iPad and MBA to talk to each other the same way OneNote syncs across all my devices. I think I would have run into the full cloud storage issue much quicker with OneNote but my institution gives 1TB storage to all students and that's why I haven't noticed things filling up.

Manual RAM timings, silicon lottery numbers (when people share their personal results after building the system).  I save a lot of these resources to my HDD for future reference.

For many years their products were rubbish, and it's only been in the last few years that they've really transitioned into a competitive and now premium brand.  It used to be a value based budget option only.  Also.. in 20 years, the only CPUs I've ever had fail have been AMD.

I recently got an iPhone and wanted to use the app on my phone but I realize I'm not seeing it in my app list and when I search the app on app store it asks me to purchase it again. After some googling I saw a comment where it might ask you to purchase but you won't actually be charged -- so I went ahead and purchased it again, but I think I was actually charged for the app. After further googling, I see that GoodNotes 5 for Mac and iPhone/iPad need to be purchased separately but I do not own a MacOS device, I only bought iPad version which is supposed to be the same as iPhone version.

tag classification,"Ram mangement is trash! The ram management of the GoodNotes Mac App is trash, it never releases any of the Ram it takes if you don't quit the application manually, even if you close taps or document. It easily takes 2-3 GB of ram on my 8GB M1 MacBook Air. (I know the performance is trash on Intel Macs as well but it is actually usable on Apple silicon) 

This is not an issue on iPads because the iPadOS handels Ram differently. There, the least needed app is just removed from Ram completely when ram is needed (with no mercy). MacOS has more mercy which it honestly shouldn't have when there are a lot of apps that don't handle ram responsibly, like GoodNotes and Notability. ['Mommy!!! 🤤', ""Did AA at West Point 2 years ago.

tag classification,"Free Cornell Expanded Templates (White) Hey,

I was getting a bit frustrated with having to use the Cornell page with the summary, so I've created an extended version which includes:

\- First Page with space for header and no summary

\- Notes Page with space for notes only

\- Summary Page which includes a slightly extended space for the summary

It's just an edit of the existing Goodnotes template, so can be used seamlessly with it.
