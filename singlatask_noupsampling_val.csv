tag classification,"handwriting recognition Dumb question, but does GoodNotes not recognize handwritten numbers? Whenever I‚Äôm searching a number within my handwritten notes, it never comes up. I think I write my numbers pretty neat but it rarely ever recognizes it.. Are handwritten numbers just not supported? ['Ok I just did a test for numbers and searches.  When I search for a single number like 1 or 3 nothing comes up.  I searched for a word next to the number - and it does recognize it as a number.  i.e.\n\n1 love - search for 1 doesn\'t find it.  Search for love and the 1 shows up converted in the search.  So it definitely finds and transcribes numbers.\n\nSo then I tried writing a 12 as neatly as possible - boom it shows up - so somehow a single number or letter search doesn\'t work.  I also tried searching for the letter ""a"" - and that turned up nothing but ""an"" showed a bunch.\n\nSo maybe try writing 01 02 and 03 - I did that and the search found those.  And TBH I was doing my date numbering using Art Deco style - which look look cool but I didn\'t think handwriting recognition would find it.  But It did as long as I searched and had 2 numbers.']",Question

tag classification,"How long does it take for you to complete a page of notes? Curious about this as I find it can take me anywhere between 2-5 hours to get a whole page done (A4) (or 1-3 hours for A3). 

I definitely find myself sacrificing productivity for concerns about aesthetics and fiddling around with minor layout/text size/whatever things, and it makes me wonder whether taking notes this way is actually worth the time I spend or not. How do you guys deal with this? Do you find with time you become quicker as you get used to setting out notes and finding a way that works for you? I've been using Goodnotes for a few months now, but not regularly (and prior to this I've never really taken notes before in my life lol) so I could just be needing time to find compromises and methods that work. 

Also, as a bit of a bonus q - how do you guys deal with not taking down too much unnecessary information as part of your notes? I find myself often copying almost entire pages/paragraphs from my textbook near word for word, rather than being able to effectively summarise information. If anyone has any links to guides on note taking I'd really appreciate them (not Cornell though :&lt; something about that style pisses me off even just thinking about it).

Hope you're all having a good day :) ['Aesthetic notes are pleasing to read later. I loved those notes too, but I think it they are the result of perfectionism. I make my notes only okay, with readable handwriting, some alignment of stuff/formulas/etc and some highlighting. That‚Äôs it. Rest is only our desire to make beautiful notes. If you‚Äôre wondering, I fill a Goodnotes standard paper in about 30 minutes. Would be 45 to 55 for A4. Don‚Äôt spend a lot of time decorating them. \nAs for the copying, you don‚Äôt need to clone your textbook in a beautiful manner, the best way of taking notes is summarising. I don‚Äôt have any resources except for YouTube Videos by Ali Abdaal, Anas Nuur Ali, and KharmaMedic. \nHere‚Äôs a tip, in a language, you have some keywords and some grammar terms.

Instead of focusing on making it look pretty, I just wrote whatever quickly using 1 pen style, and highlighting / circling the important parts quickly.

What I like about digital note taking is you can always use the lasso tool to move stuff around, so I rearrange the layout only after I‚Äôm done with the entire page.\nHand-writing notes does take extra time though, I can never do it for all my courses. So I choose one or two most challenging ones and hand write notes for those.

tag classification,"thinking about getting an ipad... ... to take digital notes for school. i start university this fall, so I have enough time to save for the iPad Air. My only question is whether you feel that it‚Äôs worth it to take digital notes. I for one love how the layout of digital notes look and the convenience of it all.

If you could possible leave your personal experiences with switching from paper to digital notes, that would be great! ['I switched to digital notes during my second year of college and as such have six semesters and three years of experience with them, and I can say I GREATLY prefer them over physical notes.  The ability to search for things in-text but still have the option to draw diagrams makes them very useful.  I also like them for future reference, because I have all of the notebooks from my last three years in college and none of them from my first two, and I can access them both on my iPad and any other device which can access Google Drive.', 'That certainly sounds convenient. Knowing me, I‚Äôm Prly gonna end up buying the iPad, I just wanna hear stories from other people about this', ""I love it! It takes some time to getting used to, the writing feeling especially, but it's very practical. You can access your notes from literally anywhere if you Auto synch them as a pdf (as well with/instead of via iCloud, I do both) so if you just want to look something up but don't have your iPad with you, your notes are on your Cloud. It also saves so much paper. My brother, who is also doing online school but doesn't take notes digitally, has to print out sooo much and I can just import it and write on the iPad. Also being able to search your notes is so practical\n\nI really like it and spend so much time on my iPad I'd say it's a must have for me"", ""I switched over to writing my notes on a ipad earlier this year. I was initially concerned whether or not I'll like it but so far it's working fantastically for me. I can't recommend it enough"", 'I bought an iPad Air a couple months back to take my work notes digital and I only wish I did it sooner. My work recently became very note intensive and I‚Äôve gone through umpteen notepads since lockdown began and having to rifle back to find old notes was becoming unmanageable. With GoodNotes you can search your handwritten notes which is awesome!\n\nSuch an amazing feeling with an Apple Pencil and a matte screen protector.\n\n100% go for it. You won‚Äôt regret it', 'Honestly having an iPad for college completely changed my college experience. I switched to an iPad for notetaking my third semester in college after killing so many trees printing out powerpoint after powerpoint to take notes on. The iPad completely changed this: no more hauling around notebooks and binders, no more losing pencils and refilling ink in pens... it‚Äôs just awesome. As a perfectionist but also someone who loves writing in pen, I would constantly be stressed out in fear of messing up my notes and having to scratch out work on paper. On the iPad, you can just undo it and forget it ever happened! I‚Äôd highly recommend the iPad Air for notetaking and choosing Goodnotes :)', 'Okay, thank you so much üòä', 'I def gotta get it now', ""I wish I hadn't finished college yet so I could use my iPad lol. In the last year I took notes in Evernote with my Moto G4."", 'I started digital note-taking in my last year of school. I used a Lenovo Yoga with onenote to write stuff down. I mostly write mathematical stuff so having a pen for these is a no-brainer for me. I gave many people advice on digital note-taking, which device is the best one for them etc, and i boiled it down to a few questions you should ask yourself :\n\n1. Do you ACTUALLY need digital notes? What is the real benefit of making them because it\'s kind of hyped now and many people just ""do some scetches"" or just ""write that one equation down"", for those it is probably not the best thing to do. Don\'t forget: Digital note-taking is expensive. Every device which is capable of taking digital notes with a pen is relatively expensive, ipads (especially the pro-line), laptops which can be flipped(like the one i used) or laptop/tablet hybrids (like the surface pro).\n\n2. If you decide it\'s worth your money, pick a device that fits your needs. If you pretty much only use a pen (and have a ""real computer at hand) get an iPad, the pen is straight up the best in the game. If you also need some power on the go, get something like the yoga, it\'s a solid laptop with up to 8 cores, 32GB of ram, blablabla, depends on your needs and also if you use this as your only machine or as a secondary device.\n\n3. Maybe a normal laptop is just right for you? If you study something like languages, economics or law, you will be mostly writing texts. So having a good keyboard is a necessity. In that case, a normal laptop would be pretty much all you need. Be honest with yourself and don\'t just buy something because ""well XY is using this for his studies so it must work for me"".\n\n4. Do you have the skills to actually benefit from the digital world? I know, this sounds harsh because ""of course i have those, i mean this is the modern world and i live inside of it"". But believe it or not, many of my colleagues just don\'t have the skill set to efficiently take digital notes. Not just copy/paste, but you have to adjust your work flow, keep your data in a useful structure, make backups (seriously, if anyone reads this and doesn\'t have a backup of his/her notes, make one right now) and many other things like ""how does my colleague get this thing"", what if i want to collab with people etc etc etc... \n\n\nPaper with a pen let\'s you do everything you can imagine, but every application, every device you use is designed by people who are thinking different than you. I got really frustrated while trying to find THE PERFECT App for taking notes until i figured out, not a single app can do everything i want it to.\nI still use a good ol\' paper-notebook for brainstorming, just because it gives me the opportunity to do exactly what i want, no ""super smooth curves"" or ""super clean images"". Some things are just messy in and of itself, and nothing is better at capturing your thoughts that a piece of paper and a pen.\n\n\nMaybe this sounds like a rant, i am really not, but maybe this should be a step into seeing the downsides of digital note-taking and not just the beautiful future we want it to be...\n\nIf you want some further advice, just pm me, budget, usage are pretty important factors (as i already mentioned) so with more information about your future use case etc maybe i can be a little more helpful', ""It definitely is, it's helped my organisation so much. No more forgetting notes/textbooks to class as I only need to remember my iPad, and no more breaking my back with said books in my backpack."", 'I finished my first degree by mostly writing on paper. At least during the lectures. I usually wrote a study guide on my laptop but it wasn\'t perfect. I always wished for a way to make it pretty and efficient by highlighting definitions in boxes or just highlight with a digital highlighter. To be honest I think I would have been happy with paper notes but I always wished for an iPad it was just too expensive I thought.\nIn my last year I used a surface thinking I would have a laptop that\'s easy to carry around for writing stuff with a keyboard but I also wanted to take digital handwritten notes. My biggest problem with taking digital hand written notes on the surface was that I was using one note and it just didn\'t work for me. I\'ve searched ages for an app that would let you annotated PDFs and also let\'s you put pages ""in between"" because my studying often required answering questions in the scripts. All the apps I found were prescription based and thats\'s just unnecessary expensive imo. I just hated that I had three binders for math because I wanted to have the questions of the lecture of my homework and of studying separately. With goodnotes you can have these different binders all in one place.\n\nI also want to highlight the functions of digital notes during covid-19. My university requires us to upload our homework or work in teams online. And it\'s just so much easier to share your screen or send an email with you homework without scanning it first.\nSooo long story short my boyfriend bought an iPad and i used it everytime he didn\'t. I loved it so much that I bought my own and i regret I didn\'t do that earlier.', 'I agree with everyone who is saying that it takes time to get used to! I always swore that I would never make the switch. I lugged around my pens, mildliners, and Moleskines in college because I was determined not to go digital. Then I started thinking about grad school and realized that things like books and articles could be exported into Goodnotes and annotated, and I caved. I would never EVER switch back. I love digital notes SO much. \n\nedit: (I have the iPad Pro)\n\nedit #2 lol I truly never read other poster‚Äôs comments before posting my own. I skim them. This is in response to mathematical Lenovo user. \n\nFirstly, I would be wary of any Microsoft user who is warning you off buying a Mac product. In my experience, it‚Äôs 80/20 that they have a strong anti-Mac bias. (I used exclusively Microsoft products pre-2016)\n\nSecondly, I have a Macbook Pro 2016 and an iPad Pro May 2020 model. These are my two primary devices. My use for them will be different from our mathematical friend over at Lenovo. Still, I‚Äôll say this from my own experience‚ÄîI am shocked just often I reach for my iPad after years of using my Macbook for everything. Now, this will not be your case. The iPad Pro can replace some functions of the Macbook Pro, but even then, it can‚Äôt substitute itself for one. However, with a keyboard and a mouse, you‚Äôre a hell of a lot more equipped to run the iPad as a ‚ÄúMobile Oval,‚Äù to lovingly quote from ‚ÄúVeep.‚Äù It‚Äôs your presidential replacement on the go, and from what I understand, even the iPad Air can handle that. (Isn‚Äôt the Gen 2 Apple Pencil now compatible with the Air?) \n\nSecondly.Two, if you‚Äôll take a recommendation from me, ditch the stupid keyboard case and cut straight for the Logitech super slim keyboard. It‚Äôs waterproof and weighs very little. I love mine. Get a cheap case from Amazon or something. The keyboard cases are ridiculously overpriced. The Logitech keyboard is something like $70 and holds a charge forever. \n\nThirdly, I don‚Äôt know what your learning style is, what your major might be, or what else you may want to consider, but digital note-taking is an excellent idea for people with significant reading loads. I was an English education major, and I‚Äôll be attending a master‚Äôs program for journalism this fall. I foresaw a hefty reading load. That means I had to lug around several literary anthologies, print out hundreds of short stories etc., etc. It would‚Äôve saved me money to buy the iPad in the first place. \n\nFourthly, I do want to point out that you shouldn‚Äôt be buying the iPad because of what you see from this trend in digital note-taking. It‚Äôs very pretty, and that is definitely why I love it, but it is a considerable expense. I am impulsive by nature. If you are wise, you may want to have someone sit down with you and work out the figures. \n\nI would say I printed well over 8k pages while in undergrad. That‚Äôs for sure lowballing. I know for one class alone, I had to have printed at least a thousand. And that was one single semester. Weigh printer costs against what you would save. I don‚Äôt know. Maybe you will break even, and perhaps it‚Äôll be significantly more expensive to buy the iPad. I‚Äôm not a math person. \n\nFifth, and finally, I think it‚Äôs essential that you have something to look forward to going into college. I think it‚Äôs worth noting that I use my iPad every single day and have used it almost every day since I purchased it. Now, granted, I did buy it during quarantine, so that‚Äôs not a perfect example. However, I do use Goodnotes every day, and I am currently not working and am not attending school until the fall. \n\nSome highlights:\n\n* I love digital planning now. I was never a consistent planner before, but now I try to plan out my week (or at least jot some things down). I bought my planner from Three65Planners on Etsy, and I highly recommend it. It‚Äôs loaded with hyperlinks and templates. \n* Organization. I have severe ADHD, and my organization has always been ‚Äúthrow things anywhere.‚Äù Goodnotes‚Äô search feature is fantastic, and I have tons of folders. \n* Color options. I have 150 pen presets, and 48 highlighter presets on Goodnotes. Think about lugging around 150 pens and 48 highlighters, a huge planner, and 70 journals. That would suck. \n* Stickers. Digital stickers are super fun. I have over a thousand digital stickers saved! \n\n\nA downside:\n* Learning to write on an iPad sucks. I highly recommend getting a palm rejection glove. My handwriting looked like a third-grader when I first got my iPad.', 'Yes go for it, personally it completely changed the game and my grades have improved vastly. I have the ipad 7th gen and the first apple pencil, i also have a keyboard case from amazon i use if i need it but i mainly write everything down. I like goodnotes because i am able to access my notes &amp; digital textbooks on my phone and on my laptop through google drive.', 'From an old response to this question but -\n\n‚ÄúI would highly recommend it. I got one my second year of college and haven‚Äôt looked back. I honestly forget what it‚Äôs like to take notes on physical paper. It‚Äôs super convenient having all your searchable notes, pdf textbooks, lecture slides, and multiple colored pens and highlighters of all different sizes all in one tiny place. I‚Äôve compared some of my notes since getting my iPad to before and it‚Äôs night and day in terms of readability and structure. It‚Äôs kind of weird to say but digital note taking makes taking notes ‚Äúfun‚Äù. I could go on forever about all the benefits but there are a few cons.\nFrom my experience, I‚Äôve encountered a very small amount of things that made me say ‚Äúugh‚Äù since the switch. With everything technology, there will be occasional issues and bugs (e.g. documents disappearing, random spazzes when writing with the Apple Pencil, etc), but these have happened to me maybe a handful of times. Plus, there are plenty of ways to mitigate the damages of these bugs.\nI‚Äôve motivated like 4-5 of my friends to switch to digital note taking and they‚Äôve enjoyed the switch. One of my friends has atrocious handwriting and him switching helped him create more readable notes to reference later. Just remember it works for some people better than others. I know people who‚Äôd rather take paper notes because the feel and it helps them retain information better. If you have an Apple Store near you or a friend who has an iPad, give it a try. Copy some of your handwritten notes over on the iPad and see what you think. Try to improve them in the process to get a feel of ways it might help make your notes better. Good luck!‚Äù', ""You'll definitely get biased opinions in this subreddit, but I agree with what others have said here!

I initially was worried about missing paper and stationary and all that but taking notes on the iPad and reading is so much more convenient especially if you like to study in libraries or coffee shops. You can also make them really pretty and nice if you enjoy that. It will save you so much time especially because in university the information they give you is just all over the place and they love giving lots of slides and handouts so I definitely recommend using an iPad to make it more convenient and easy.

I‚Äôd be genuinely interested in learning about them.', ""Take Microsoft word in pc for example - it lets you take a screenshot of any other window or it lets you select what you want to inlcude into a document.
